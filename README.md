# Number-Guesser-Python

## Overview

This repository is a basic implementation of a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number within a specified range and the user attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

## How to Play the Game?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the game: `numberGuesser.py`.
3. Enter the maximum value for the guessing range.
4. Guess a number within the specified range.
5. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
6. Continue guessing until you guess the correct number.
7. Have Fun!
